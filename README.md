# The Qual programming language

Qual is a low level, performance based programming language. It's designed to be fast, safe and testable language. Featuring classical functional features including:
* Closures
* First class functions
* Immutable state
* Pattern matching
* Type polymorphism
* Lazy evaluation
* Monads

Closures, first class functions, pattern matching, type polymorphism and monads are all used to create readable, testable and maintainable code. Lazy evaluation is great for handling big data and AI. Also, mutable state allows for safe threading which is very important in subjects like webservers.
